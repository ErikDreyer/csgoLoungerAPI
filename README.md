# csgoLoungerAPI
Small python script that pulls the match data form the csgolounge.com API

This is just a small script that pulls the match data form the csgolounge.com API (csgolounge.com/api/mathces.php). The raw data will be written and saved to the rawData.txt file, and the parsed match data will be written and saved to the matchData.txt file.

In the API file, some data is incomplete or mixed up, my script removes all these matches and outputs the rest.

HOW TO USE:
Run the apiScraper file, this will output 2 files: rawData.txt and matchData.txt

What you do with this is your own responsibility, I accept no repsonsibility for your actions with this code.
